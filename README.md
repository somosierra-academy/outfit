<h1>Classifying outfit with Pytorch</h1>

Run your first machine learning model using Pytorch. 

PyTorch is an open-source machine learning framework that allows developers to easily build and train neural networks. It was developed by Facebook's artificial intelligence research group and released in 2016. PyTorch is built on top of Python and provides two main features: a multi-dimensional tensor library and a dynamic computational graph.

In this session you'll address the following topics: 

* Starting off with Pytorch
* First steps with Pytorch dataset tools 
* Understanding datasets format
* Splitting data for a machine learning project
* Brief introduction to matplotlib
* Enabling GPUs for machine learning
* Define your first Neural Network
* Use the loss function to compare predictions
* Configuring basic blocks of a training loop
* Running your first model
* Saving and loading models
* Using your brand-new model to predict
